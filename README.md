 Image Classification (ImageNet Library) using Transfer Learning - Keras InceptionResNetV2 (Deep Learning)
Transfer learning uses "knowledge gained in solving a problem" and applies it to a different but related problem. In Transfer Learning, we use a model that has been previously trained on a dataset and includes weights and biases that represent the properties of the dataset it was trained on. In this project, we will use the InceptionResNetV2 model, which has a pre-trained 164-layer advanced architecture and is pre-trained with an ImageNet dataset containing more than 1 million images.
